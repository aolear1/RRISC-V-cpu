# RRISC-V-cpu
A reduced reduced intruction set computer that won the 2023 CPEN 211 Lab 7 competition. The top level file is build for a DE1SOC with the added pin assignments.

The code itself is messy, uncommented and overall not very clean, but it holds a special place in my heart. 

Handles the following instructions: 
# Control Flow Instructions
- B
- BEQ
- BNE
- BLT
- BLE
